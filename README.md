# DLockers

This repo produces a [server](Server/) and a [client](Client/) applications that communicate peer-to-peer using the IOTA network.
We are not interested in crypto's speculative side. 


Use the [web client](https://eddytheco.github.io/DLockers/Client/) or set a [MockUpServer](https://eddytheco.github.io/DLockers/MockupServer/).

Watch the [showcase video](https://youtu.be/JoLe93Gzwho?si=A9S8vM_HUYCxYcHv)
Read how the [Dedicated Post](https://eddytheco.github.io/Shimmerpp/posts/NFT_as_Ticket_in_IoT/) and contribute!

## The bigger picture

* Any person can start renting physical space for lockers.
* You do not depend on centralized company servers to store your business data or to process payments.
* As long as you maintain a node(blockchain), your gainings  and business data are cryptographically secured. 
* The open source code grants you certain rights and responsibilities to respect other people's rights.
* By using NFTs the client can pass the right to open a box to other clients.

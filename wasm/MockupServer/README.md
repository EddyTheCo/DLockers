# [Mockup Server](https://eddytheco.github.io/Dlockers/MockupServer/index.html)

This is a mock-up server for testing the Dlockers protocol.
It will allow you to set a Dlocker server.
For the server to start working one has to send some coins to the server account.
The server can use your position as the server position, by default it will take a random position.
Take into account your position will be disclosed publicly if you allow it. 

You can also set up a real [Dlocker server](https://github.com/EddyTheCo/Dlockers/main/Server/)
You can book on the server by using the [Dlocker Client](https://github.com/EddyTheCo/Dlockers/main/Client/)

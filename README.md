# DLockers

This repo produce a [server](https://github.com/EddyTheCo/DLockers/tree/main/Server/) and a [client](https://github.com/EddyTheCo/DLockers/tree/main/Client/) applications that communicate peer-to-peer using the IOTA network.
We are not interested in the speculative side of crypto and we are not associated with the Iota Foundation. 
We discourage investing in Shimmer and IOTA because that will be investing in the Iota Foundation and its pursuit of centralizing the development and protocol. 





## The bigger picture

* Any person can start renting physical space for lockers.
* You do not depend on centralized company servers to store your business data or to process payments.
* As long as you maintain a node(blockchain), your gainings  and business data are cryptographically secured. 
* The code is open source and grants you certain rights and responsibilities to respect other people's rights.
* By using NFTs the client can pass the right to open a box to other clients.
